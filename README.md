###### My development fork of the [Paragon Public Policy Fellowship's Website](https://www.paragonfellowship.org), which I'm responsible for developing. The site's made in next with tsx complete with all sorts of custom components and animations that will hopefully help this project stand out.

#### USE "npm run dev" to run the entire project
#### USE "npm run build" to test before deploying
